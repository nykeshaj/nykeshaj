## :wave: Welcome!

### About Me
My name is Nykesha Johnson and I currently work as a Research & Data Associate with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health in the Division of Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention. I have  been passionate about understanding the ways in which social determinants of health (income, food access, built environment) influence health outcomes particularly in low-income and historically underrepresetnetd communities for many years, and I am excited about the opportunity to combine my passion for health equity with a growing love for data science.  

### Projects
In my current role, I am responsible for conducting research and evaluation projects related to the division's program areas of interest, including tobacco control, nutrition, physical activity, and injury prevention. In this role I have conducted several data analysis projects to evaluate current and inform future city policy and develop visualiztions, some projects that I am most proud of include:

- ATF?
- Tobacco Retailer Density Calculations
- Quitline Media Campaign Evaluation
- Trends in Philadelphia Quitline Utilization
- Rental Unit Analysis
